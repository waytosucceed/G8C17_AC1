                    When we talk to people our facial expressions, hand gestures and body language express our strong, mild, and weak emotions. How to express the same while writing? The English language provides a solution to this crisis by offering us with an abundance of words, phrases and expressions that we can use to express our emotions succinctly in writing. We also use them in our daily conversations. They are collectively called <span style="color: blue;">interjections</span>.
                    <br><br>We must keep in mind that interjections are a grammatically independent part of speech. Thus, they can often be removed from a sentence without impacting its meaning.

I cannot find the notebook where we both recorded all the research that we did on extinct birds for the project.<br><br> Olivia: Alas! What a loss. The project is due in seven days and we had invested around fifteen days just to study about extinct birds.",

                       "Charlotte: Well, in that case we have to narrow down our focus area to something special about one or two birds. Since we don’t have much time, we won't be able to work a certain category of birds in detail.<br><br>Olivia: Ah, thank you for that input Charlotte.

Primary interjections are words or sounds that can only be used as an interjection. They do not have alternate meanings and thus cannot be used as other parts of speech like a noun, verb or an adjective.",

It is an example of a primary interjection. Also note that a mild interjection is followed by a comma and a strong interjection is followed by an exclamation mark. Thus, here “Ah” is a mild interjection. <br><br><span style='color:blue'><i>“I am in. Let's go!”</i></span><br><br>“Let’s go” is an example of a volitive interjection.

                       "<span style='color:blue'><i>Phew! We finally have something really interesting to present.</i></span><br><br> “Phew” in the above sentence is used to express relief here. It is an example of an emotive interjection. Emotive interjections are used to express an emotion concerning a reaction to something. Charlotte was relieved to hear from Olivia something interesting about hummingbirds, which they can immediately include in their project and finish within a short period of time. ",
